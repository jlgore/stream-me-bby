# nowPlaying.js

This is a script to pull the currently playing song from an icecast/azuracast channel and write it to a file. Then I am trying to make this ffmpeg shell script I copied from some fucking gist somewhere to work to stream a video + icecast audio + overlay text of the song name. There are TODOs. Too many TODO.
